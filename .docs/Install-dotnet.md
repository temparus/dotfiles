# dotnet

There is a community driven overlay [gentoo/dotnet](https://github.com/gentoo/dotnet).

Use the ebuilds from this overlay to install mono.

If you need the dotnet Core SDK / Runtime, you can install the binary packages from this overlay, or use the [Installer script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) from Microsoft.
