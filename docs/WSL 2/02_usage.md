# Usage

## Terminal

I really like the new [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

## Visual Studio Code

When Visual Studio Code is installed on Windows together with the extension `Remote - WSL` from Microsoft, you can open VSCode with a directory within the linux filesystem by just typing the following command in the desired folder within the linux console/filesystem.

```shell
code .
```
